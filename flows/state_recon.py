"""
Automated Slot Studio — State Recon Flow

Point this at ANY US state and it autonomously:
1. RESEARCHES current gambling statutes, definitions, exemptions, case law, AG opinions
2. ANALYZES legal definitions to map what triggers "gambling" vs what's exempt
3. ARCHITECTS specific game mechanics that fit inside the legal safe harbor
4. GENERATES a legal defense brief mapping each mechanic to its statutory basis

Usage:
    from flows.state_recon import StateReconFlow
    flow = StateReconFlow()
    result = flow.kickoff("North Carolina")

    # Or from CLI:
    python -m flows.state_recon --state "North Carolina"
    python -m flows.state_recon --state "North Carolina" --auto  # skip HITL

Execute the following research passes using the legal_research tool:

1. STATUTES: Search for the state's core gambling statutes and penal code sections.
   Use search_pass='statutes' with state='{state.target_state}'

2. DEFINITIONS: Search for how the state legally defines 'gambling', 'game of chance',
   'consideration', 'prize', and 'skill game'.
   Use search_pass='definitions'

3. EXEMPTIONS: Search for ALL exemptions — skill games, amusement devices, sweepstakes,
   social gambling, fraternal/charitable orgs, promotional contests.
   Use search_pass='exemptions'

4. CASE LAW: Search for court rulings on skill vs chance, device classifications.
   Use search_pass='case_law'

5. ENFORCEMENT: Search for recent enforcement actions, DA posture, seizures.
   Use search_pass='enforcement'

6. LEGISLATION: Search for pending bills that might change the landscape.
   Use search_pass='legislation'

After searching, use the fetch_statute tool to retrieve the FULL TEXT of the most
important statutes and court opinions you find (at least 2-3 key sources).

Also check the search_regulations tool for any existing data on {state.target_state}.

Analyze the following legal research for {state.target_state} and build a structured
legal profile with actionable game design constraints.

RAW RESEARCH:
{research_json[:12000]}

YOUR ANALYSIS MUST INCLUDE:

1. GAMBLING DEFINITION ELEMENTS: Break down the state's definition into its required
   elements. Most states require ALL of: (a) consideration, (b) chance, (c) prize.
   Identify which TEST the state uses for chance vs skill:
   - PREDOMINANCE TEST: Is the game PREDOMINANTLY chance? (most common, most favorable)
   - ANY CHANCE TEST: Does ANY element of chance exist? (strictest)
   - MATERIAL ELEMENT TEST: Is chance a MATERIAL element? (moderate)
   - GAMBLING INSTINCT TEST: Does it appeal to the gambling instinct? (vague, risky)

2. ELEMENT NEGATION MAP: For each required element, identify how game design can
   NEGATE it:
   - Chance → Add skill elements (what kind? how much?)
   - Consideration → Free play option (sweepstakes model)
   - Prize → Prize restrictions (what's allowed?)

3. EXEMPTION ANALYSIS: For each exemption found, detail:
   - Exact requirements to qualify
   - Game design constraints imposed
   - Prize limits
   - Location/licensing requirements
   - Strength of the exemption (tested in court? well-established? untested?)

4. RISK CLASSIFICATION:
   - DEPLOY_NOW: Clear legal pathway, well-tested, low prosecution risk
   - STRUCTURED_DEPLOY: Legal but requires specific game design, moderate risk
   - GRAY_AREA: Untested loophole, could go either way
   - HIGH_RISK: Hostile enforcement, narrow exemptions
   - DO_NOT_ENTER: No viable pathway, active prosecution

5. BEST LEGAL PATHWAY: Recommend the strongest legal theory for operating a
   slot-style game in this state. Rank all viable pathways.

Design a slot-style game that is LEGALLY DEFENSIBLE in {state.target_state} based
on the following legal profile:

LEGAL PROFILE:
{profile_json[:12000]}

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:

1. LEGAL PATHWAY: Use the #1 ranked legal pathway from the profile.
   EVERY game mechanic must map to a specific legal justification.

2. SKILL ELEMENTS (if pathway requires skill):
   Design SPECIFIC, IMPLEMENTABLE skill mechanics. NOT vague concepts.
   For each skill element, specify:
   - Exact player action (e.g., "player taps to stop reels within a 500ms window")
   - How it affects outcome (e.g., "stopping within target zone awards 2x multiplier")
   - Skill/chance ratio (e.g., "skilled player achieves 94% RTP vs 88% for unskilled")
   - Implementation spec (enough detail for a developer)

3. PRIZE STRUCTURE: Design prizes that comply with state limits.
   Specify: form (cash/gift card/merchandise/credits), max value, payout mechanism.

4. PROHIBITED FEATURES: Explicitly list what the game CANNOT have.
   These are features that would push the game outside the legal safe harbor.

5. GAME FLOW: Design the complete player experience from session start to cash-out.
   Mark every point where a legal requirement is satisfied.

6. HARDWARE/SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS: If the legal pathway requires specific hardware
   (e.g., no coin slot for Virginia QVS2 model), specify it.

7. OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS: Location type, licensing, signage, age verification,
   record-keeping, tax reporting.

Generate a comprehensive legal defense brief for operating the proposed game in

LEGAL PROFILE:
{profile_json[:8000]}

GAME ARCHITECTURE:
{arch_json[:8000]}

BRIEF MUST INCLUDE:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: One-paragraph statement of the legal theory.

2. STATUTORY FRAMEWORK: Cite the exact statutes at issue.

3. ELEMENT-BY-ELEMENT DEFENSE: For each element of the gambling definition,
   demonstrate why this game does NOT satisfy that element. For each argument:
   - State the element
   - Cite the statutory basis
   - Explain how the game negates this element
   - Anticipate the prosecution's counter-argument
   - Provide a rebuttal
   - Cite supporting case law if available

4. EXEMPTION DEFENSE (if applicable): Demonstrate the game qualifies for a
   specific statutory exemption. Map each exemption requirement to a game feature.

5. SUPPORTING CASE LAW: Cite relevant cases with holdings.

6. RISK MATRIX:
   - Probability of prosecution (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
   - Probability of conviction if prosecuted (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH)
   - Severity of penalties if convicted
   - Mitigating factors

7. PROSECUTION'S BEST CASE: Honestly present the strongest argument AGAINST
   the game's legality. Then explain why it fails on the law/facts.

8. RECOMMENDED PRECAUTIONS: Specific operational steps to strengthen the defense
   (record-keeping, signage, compliance documentation, expert witnesses to retain).

9. LEGISLATIVE WATCHLIST: Laws or bills that could change the analysis.
